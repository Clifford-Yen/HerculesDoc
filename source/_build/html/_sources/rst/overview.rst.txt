Domain Reduction Method (DRM) Implementation
============================================

Hercules is capable of implementing the Domain Reduction Method (DRM). You can implement it by setting the following lines in the input files. 

.. code-block::

    implement_drm = yes
    drm_directory = directory_to_store_information_of_DRM

``directory_to_store_information_of_DRM`` mentioned above should be replace to the directory you want to store the DRM information. e.g., ``drm_directory = outputfiles/DRM``, and folders named ``part0``, ``part1``, and ``part2`` should be created manually in this directory.

There are three steps should be executed sequentially for implementing DRM in Hercules, which are part 0, part 1, and part 2.

Part 0
======
In part 0, the information of the coordinates of the DRM box would be generated.

To execute part 0 analysis, simply setting the following line in the input file.

``which_drm_part = part1``

Since the information of the coordinates of the DRM box is the only data that are generated, the end time of the simulation can be set as a small value (e.g., 1 sec). You can do so by setting the following line in the input file.

``simulation_end_time_sec = 1``
