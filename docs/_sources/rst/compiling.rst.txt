Compiling
=========

Prerequisites
=============
To compile Hercules, you need to have Open-MPI and GNU Scientific Library (GSL) installed. If you haven't installed them, the easiest way to do so is installing them via `Homebrew`_. Assuming Homebrew is installed on your machine, all you need to do is typing the following commands in the terminal one by one.

.. code-block:: shell

    brew install open-mpi
    brew install gsl

.. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh

Compiling with ``user.mk``
==========================
Although there are some predefined system configurations in ``system.mk``, it's very likely you will find that it's insufficient. As a result, it's recommended to write your own ``user.mk`` next to ``system.mk`` before you compile.

For example, the following lines can be written into ``user.mk`` and used for Intel-based Macs.

.. code-block::

    # System definition
    # -----------------

    SYSTEM = MAC

    # Main compilation setup
    # ----------------------

    CFLAGS += -g -ggdb -O3

    # Compilation flags
    # -----------------

    # CVM and IO related:

    IO_CPPFLAGS = -DUSECVMDB -DSCEC  -DPROCPERNODE=4

    ifeq ($(SYSTEM), MAC)
        MPI_DIR      = /usr/local
        MPI_INCLUDE  = $(MPI_DIR)/include/openmpi/ompi/mpi/cxx
        CC           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicc
        CXX          = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
        LD           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
        CXXFLAGS    += -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK
        CFLAGS      += -Wall
        CPPFLAGS    += -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
        LDFLAGS     += $(MPI_DIR)/lib/libgsl.a
    endif

    LDFLAGS += -lgslcblas -lgsl

Note that the indentation used in a makefile should be tabs, not spaces. If you copy the code block above, make sure to replace all spaces with tabs.

Compiling Procedure
===================
To compile Hercules, make sure to :code:`cd` into Hercules' folder and simply run the following lines in the terminal one by one.

.. code-block::

    make cleanall
    make

Now, you are all set.

Side Notes for Apple Silicon Macs
=================================
If you are installing Hercules on ARM-based Macs, which are equipped with M1/M2/M3 SoC (the Apple Silicon), here are some notes for you to install Hercules successfully.

* Install Open-MPI and GSL with native Apple Silicon support using natively supported Homebrew. The installed Open-MPI and GSL should be located under :code:`/opt/homebrew/`
* Change ``user.mk`` accordingly
* (Optional) The last step of compiling procedure (:code:`make`) might need to be replaced with :code:`arch -arm64e make`

``user.mk`` for Apple Silicon Macs can be written as follows.

.. code-block::

    # System definition
    # -----------------

    SYSTEM = ARMMAC

    # Main compilation setup
    # ----------------------

    CFLAGS += -g -ggdb -O3

    # Compilation flags
    # -----------------

    # CVM and IO related:

    IO_CPPFLAGS = -DUSECVMDB -DSCEC  -DPROCPERNODE=4

    ifeq ($(SYSTEM), ARMMAC)
        MPI_DIR      = /opt/homebrew
        MPI_INCLUDE  = $(MPI_DIR)/include/
        CC           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicc
        CXX          = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
        LD           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
        CXXFLAGS    += -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK
        CFLAGS      += -Wall -I$(MPI_DIR)/include/
        CPPFLAGS    += -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
        LDFLAGS     += -L$(MPI_DIR)/lib/
    endif

    LDFLAGS += -lgslcblas -lgsl

And yes, you can combine this section with the ``user.mk`` for Intel-based Macs. Just make sure you set the correct :code:`SYSTEM` variable. Alternatively, you can use :code:`uname -s` to determine the system type and :code:`uname -m` to determine the system architecture, and set the :code:`SYSTEM` and :code:`ARCH` variables accordingly. Here is an example:

.. code-block::

    # System definition
    # -----------------

    SYSTEM = $(shell uname -s | tr A-Z a-z)
    ARCH   = $(shell uname -m | tr A-Z a-z)

    # Main compilation setup
    # ----------------------

    CFLAGS += -g -ggdb -O3

    # Compilation flags
    # -----------------

    # CVM and IO related:

    IO_CPPFLAGS = -DUSECVMDB -DSCEC  -DPROCPERNODE=4

    ifeq ($(SYSTEM), darwin)
        ifeq ($(ARCH), arm64)
            MPI_DIR      = /opt/homebrew
            MPI_INCLUDE  = $(MPI_DIR)/include/
            CC           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicc
            CXX          = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
            LD           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
            CXXFLAGS    += -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK
            CFLAGS      += -Wall -I$(MPI_DIR)/include/
            CPPFLAGS    += -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
            LDFLAGS     += -L$(MPI_DIR)/lib/
        else
            MPI_DIR      = /usr/local
            MPI_INCLUDE  = $(MPI_DIR)/include/openmpi/ompi/mpi/cxx
            CC           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicc
            CXX          = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
            LD           = $(MPI_DIR)/bin/mpicxx
            CXXFLAGS    += -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK
            CFLAGS      += -Wall
            CPPFLAGS    += -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
            LDFLAGS     += $(MPI_DIR)/lib/libgsl.a
        endif
    endif

    LDFLAGS += -lgslcblas -lgsl
